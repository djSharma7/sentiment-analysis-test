173	Packaging	a	I tried this Herbal Neem face wash. I have oily skin. So, it proved very good to me. Gives a fresh feeling to your skin everyone u use it. I use to wash my face thrice in a day at least and that's why able to control lots of skin issues. The only thing I disliked about it is it's packaging. As I started to open my new bottle after wrapping off the plastic skin and moved the cap in order to unplug it, the cap broke off. It was not much pressure. I tried to plug it on, but didn't succeed. The whole bottle became worthless. I lost my excitement.

344	Product	a	Got my hands on this face scrub in lightening deal Do let me know if u find this review helpful Received a luxurious looking product. Pros It actually works as claimed.. the skin feels clean, soft and cool !! As it contains Activated charcoal, it deep cleanses dirt and grime particles of pollutants from skin. Brings instant glow to skin texture for sure. Unclogs pores and minimises acne, pimples.. upto 90%. Fragrance is awesome and refreshing. Can be used for both male and female skin types. Effective for oily to dry skin types . The quantity is good enough. It's a value for money product as I got it in 224 while mrp is 299 Cons Contains all chemical ingredients. The consistency is very thin and it flows a lot.. giving a feeling like it has water mixed in it.. Overall , it's worth a try when there is any deal on it !
